    "# Utility Maximization and Income Constraint\n",
    "\n",
    "The utility function in economics is a representation of the individual preferences of goods or services apart from the explicity monetary value of those goods or services. This utility function measure how much someone desires some good or service. This concept of utility helps to explain and measure mathematically different social constructs. \n",
    "\n",
    "The utility maximization consists on obtaining the values of units of two or more goods or services that maximize the utility of a certain individual. But this function needs to be constraint, because in real life all the purchases of goods and services are constrained by the budget or income that a person has. The constraint is that the income ($I$) needs to be equal  to the money spent on product, which is equal to the number of units of that product multiplied by the unit price of that product. \n",
    "\n",
    "So we can define the problem, using a *Cobb-Douglas* utility function of 4 products, as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$max_{(x,y,z,w)}U = x^{\\alpha}y^{\\beta}z^{\\gamma}w^{\\delta}$$\n",
